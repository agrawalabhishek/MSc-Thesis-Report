The study of the dynamics of a particle, on or around an asteroid, can be broadly divided into three main regimes. The first regime involves the study of surface ejecta generation, from natural events such as interplanetary particle impacts, cratering by other asteroids \& electrostatic dust levitation, or from space exploration events where the natural state of the regolith is disturbed by spacecraft sampling activities. The second regime involves the study of the subsequent orbital behavior of impact ejecta or lofted regolith under varying parameters such as launch conditions, asteroid rotational state \& shape, regolith particle size and density, Solar phase etc. And finally, the third regime involves the study of particle dynamics when it re-impacts with the surface of the asteroid. This thesis will concern itself with the second regime of research, i.e., the natural orbital evolution of regolith lofted from an asteroidâ€™s surface.

As mentioned earlier in \Cref{chap:intro}, understanding particulate environment around small-bodies has been identified by \gls{NASA} as a strategic knowledge gap. Understanding and developing tools or knowledge to estimate the orbital behavior and final fate of lofted regolith with greater accuracy is important for future space exploration missions (see \Cref{sec:future_missions}) that will involve direct interactions with asteroids, to avoid any damage to the spacecraft or surface robotic crew from orbiting particles. High-fidelity simulations of particulate motion can also help scientists in understanding the surface morphology of asteroids by helping them recreate cratering events. In \Cref{sec:literature_review}, we highlighted the shortfalls in the research done on the topic so far and we identified a gap that needs to be filled, and hence, the following top level research question is set:

This top-level research question is divided into the following sub-questions that help in structuring the thesis:
%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the regolith, launched from different locations such as leading, trailing, longest and shortest edge of an asteroid, show characteristic differences?
\item
