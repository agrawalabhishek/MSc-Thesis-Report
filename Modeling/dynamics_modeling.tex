This chapter will focus on accurate modeling of the asteroid environment and the equations of motion of a particle around it in presence of gravitational and Solar perturbations.

\section{Modeling Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}
The simulator designed as part of this research (see \Cref{chap:naos}) involves some degree of approximation of the real-world dynamical environment around the asteroid. Every degree-of-freedom and complexity added to a simulator to resemble the real-world, will also act as a potential source of error. By designing a relatively simpler simulator, we can explain the characteristic behavior of regolith through fundamentals while keeping the sources of error to as low as possible. Ofcourse, we verify the simulator (see \Cref{chap:v_and_v}) but by including a higher degree of fidelity in the simulator, we increase the workload on the verification process as well, thereby reducing the scientific output in the end. Moreover, the current simulator and the results from it will act as a benchmark for a higher-fidelity simulator in the future. Thus, the approximations made in this thesis are mentioned as follows:
% Every research involves some degree of approximation of the natural world, on Earth or otherwise, to understand or explain any phenomenon. Through this thesis work, we hope to understand the orbital behavior of regolith around an asteroid and we have to do it with a relatively simplified model because recreating an exact replica of an asteroid's dynamical environment is out of the scope of this thesis. Although we are making simplifications, but it does not mean that the scientific returns from it would be any less. The particle trajectories might not be exact when we conduct the simulation based experiments in real world but the underlying science explaining the orbital behavior would remain unchanged (this would become more clear in \Cref{chap:results}). Thus, the simplifying assumptions we make for modeling the asteroid-regolith system are mentioned as follows:
%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item The asteroid body is modeled as a smooth triaxial ellipsoid to account for its non-uniform gravity. The reasons for choosing this model over others will be explained later in \Cref{sec:gravity}.

\item Craters, surface depressions, mountains or any other terrain deformity on the asteroid is not considered in the simulation. The body is considered to have a uniform density. This is to simplify calculations of the gravitational acceleration.

\item The asteroid is rotating uniformly about its shortest axis. This is considered for simplicity and also because most Solar System bodies would dissipate energy to eventually enter a rotational state that is uniform and about its axis of maximum moment of inertia \parencite{scheeresBook}. Hence, the approximation for the asteroid remains valid.

\item The regolith grains are assumed to be spherical in shape to simplify the \gls{SRP} calculation as the cross-sectional area of a sphere would remain the same irrespective of its attitude.

\item Multiple regolith particles are launched from a given location on the asteroid in the form of a cone to replicate ejecta from a cratering event. But all particles are assumed to be coming off from the same point, unlike that in the case of an actual cratering event. This is because the pretext of the thesis was that the regolith is lofted due to an activity from a spacecraft and such would result in relatively smaller craters (from artificial cratering events) or surface depressions. Thus assuming that all particles in this \textit{"ejecta cone"} emerge from the same point on the asteroid is reasonable and simplifies the simulation.

\item The slant angle of the \textit{"ejecta cone"} (henceforth the declination angle) from the local surface normal is kept constant at 45.0 [deg] (which is a middle value in the entire declination range from 0.0 - 90.0 [deg]). We want to consider a general case and not introduce another degree-of-freedom in terms of varying declination angles.

\item The loss of material and mass from the asteroid, when the regolith is lofted from the surface, is not modeled in the simulation since it is assumed that a very small amount of material will be displaced by a spacecraft activity. This assumption is based on the sample collected by the Hayabusa mission (see \Cref{sec:past_missions} and the references therein).

\item Interaction between individual regolith grain is not accounted for because we are simulating multiple particles being lofted at the same time and granular interaction on such a scale would be extremely complex and beyond the scope of this thesis.

\item Secondary motion of regolith, after re-impacting the surface is not modeled and it is assumed that the particles just come to a standstill.

\item The shadow region of the asteroid is not modeled which means that the solar perturbations are always acting on the regolith grain and this simplification was made since asteroids are extremely small compared to planets, and thus the orbiting particles wouldn't spend long periods of time in the shadow.

\item Perturbations are considered only from the Sun. \gls{SRP} is important because regolith grains will have higher Area-To-Mass ratios, relative to a spacecraft, and so the radiation pressure would be significantly large for them. We model the third body attraction from the Sun (\gls{STBE}) as well but not from any of the giant planets such as Jupiter or Saturn, because the magnitude of perturbation from the \gls{STBE} itself is atleast 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational acceleration when the regolith is in close proximity to the asteroid (see \Cref{chap:results}).

\item The apparent motion of the Sun around the asteroid is considered circular and in the equatorial plane of the asteroid and this was based on the orbital element measurements of all observed asteroids. Majority of these asteroids have small orbital eccentricities \parencite{malhotra2016_eccentricityDistribution}, quite a few of which have a nearly circular orbit. \cite{jedicke1998_orbitalElements} presents debiased measurements for the inclination of the \gls{MBO} and shows that a large number of asteroids have near-zero inclinations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reference Frames}
\label{sec:reference_frames}
Before describing the motion of regolith around the asteroid, its important to define the frames of reference with respect to which this motion is defined and the transformation of state vectors between these frames. We use two asteroid centric reference frames, both of which are depicted in \Cref{fig:reference_frame}. Since we will be using a triaxial ellipsoid to model an asteroid (for details, see \Cref{sec:gravity}), the body-fixed rotating frame and the inertial frame with respect to this model are shown in \Cref{fig:ellipsoid_rotating_frame,fig:solar_phase_and_inertial_frame} respectively.

\label{fig:ellipsoid_rotating_frame}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
%%%
The two frames are defined as follows:
%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item \gls{AIF} - This is a non-rotating frame fixed inertially in space with its origin at the centre of mass of the asteroid . \Cref{fig:solar_phase_and_inertial_frame} shows the orientation of the frame (in \emph{x-y} plane) such that the \emph{x-axis} is pointing to the Sun when the Longitude of the Sun (or effectively the True Anomaly of the apparent circular motion of the Sun around the asteroid) $\vartheta$ is zero. The \emph{y-axis}, thus, points to the sun when $\vartheta = 90^o$ and finally the \emph{z-axis} is obtained by following the right-hand rule, coming out of the sheet in 3D.
%
\item \gls{ARF} - This frame is fixed to the rotating asteroid with its origin at the centre of mass of the asteroid and axes aligned with the principle axes of the asteroid. \Cref{fig:ellipsoid_rotating_frame} shows the orientation of this frame, assuming a triaxial ellipsoid model for our asteroid (for details see \Cref{sec:gravity}). The \emph{x-axis} is pointing along the longest axis of the triaxial ellipsoid, and the \emph{z-axis} is pointing along the shortest axis of the ellipsoid. It is also aligned with the $z_I$ axis of \gls{AIF} as shown in \Cref{fig:reference_frame}. The \emph{y-axis} points in the direction of the remaining third axis, satisfying the right-hand rule. The asteroid (and effectively the \gls{ARF}) is rotating in a counter-clockwise sense, with respect to the \gls{AIF}, with constant angular velocity $\omega$ about the $z_B$ axis as depicted in \Cref{fig:reference_frame}.
\end{enumerate}

%%%
We have two different frames of reference because it is important to visualize the same orbital motion with respect to both an inertial frame and a non-inertial frame to get a better understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this regard, it is thus important to be able to transfer a state vector between the two frames. The transfer matrix to transform a state vector from \gls{ARF} to \gls{AIF} is given as follows \parencite{schaub2003Book}:
%%%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \phi_{B}^{I} &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\
            \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
        \\
        \theta &= \omega t
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eqn:arf_to_aif_transformation matrix}
\end{equation}
%%%
In \Cref{eqn:arf_to_aif_transformation matrix}, $\theta$ is the angle of rotation between the \gls{ARF} \& the \gls{AIF} at any given time $t$; and $\omega$ is the constant angular velocity of the rotating asteroid about $z_I / z_B$ axis as shown in \Cref{fig:reference_frame}. The position vector is then transformed, from \gls{ARF} to \gls{AIF}, as follows \parencite{schaub2003Book}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_I \\
        y_I \\
        z_I
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\
        \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_B \\
        y_B \\
        z_B
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eqn:arf_to_aif_position_transformation}
\end{align}
%%%
In \Cref{eqn:arf_to_aif_position_transformation}, $x_I$ \& $x_B$ are the x-components of the position vector in \gls{AIF} and \gls{ARF} respectively; other components follow similar definitions. The velocity transformation takes place by first using the \textit{transport theorem} and then multiplying the resultant with the transformation matrix $\phi_{B}^{I}$ \parencite{schaub2003Book}. The transformation is shown as follows:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \vv{\bm{v}}_{I}^{B} &= \vv{\bm{v}}_{B} + \vv{\bm{\omega}} \times \vv{\bm{r}}_{B}
    \label{eqn:arf_to_aif_transport_theorem} \\
    \vv{\bm{v}}_I &= \phi_B^I \vv{\bm{v}}_I^B
    \label{eqn:arf_to_aif_velocity_transformation}
\end{align}
%%%
\Cref{eqn:arf_to_aif_transport_theorem} is the application of the transport theorem to get the \gls{AIF} velocity in \gls{ARF} components ($\vv{\bm{v}}_{I}^{B}$). In that, $\vv{\bm{v}}_{B}$ is the velocity vector in the \gls{ARF}, $\vv{\bm{\omega}}$ is the angular velocity vector for the asteroid's rotation (note that we have only uniform rotation about the $z_B$ axis), and $\vv{\bm{r}}_{B}$ is the position vector defined in the \gls{ARF}. In \Cref{eqn:arf_to_aif_velocity_transformation}, $\vv{\bm{v}}_I$ is the velocity vector in the \gls{AIF}.
%
\newline\newline
%
The transfer matrix to transform a state vector from \gls{AIF} to \gls{ARF} is just the transpose of $\phi_B^I$ as it is orthogonal \parencite{schaub2003Book}. It is given as follows:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \phi_{I}^{B} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos\theta & \sin\theta & 0 \\
        -\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eqn:aif_to_arf_transformation matrix}
\end{align}
%%%
Then the state vector transformation from \gls{AIF} to \gls{ARF} takes place as follows:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \bvector{r}_B &= \phi_I^B \bvector{r}_I
    \label{eqn:aif_to_arf_position} \\
    \bvector{v}_B^I &= \bvector{v}_I - \bvector{\omega} \times \bvector{r}_I
    \label{eqn:aif_to_arf_transport_theorem} \\
    \bvector{v}_B &= \phi_I^B \bvector{v}_B^I
    \label{eqn:aif_to_arf_velocity}
\end{align}
%%%
where $\bvector{v}_B^I$ is the \gls{ARF} velocity in \gls{AIF} components, and $\bvector{r}_I$ is the position vector in the \gls{AIF}.

\section{Gravitational Potential}
\label{sec:gravity}
% ...elliptic integral method and how the accelerations are calculated and the third order equation solving for lambda...
The key feature that differentiates small bodies, or asteroids for our particular case, from planets is their highly irregular shapes and thus non-spherical mass distributions \parencite{scheeresBook}. This is why the dynamics close to an asteroid are deemed as interesting and hence it is very important that the gravitational potential is modeled properly.

\subsection{Spherical \& Ellipsoidal Harmonics}
\label{subsec:spherical_ellipsoidal_harmonics}
One of the most common methods for modeling gravity potential of any celestial body is the \textit{spherical harmonics} model. In that, a sphere whose radius is equal to the maximum dimension of the irregular body, circumscribes it and this sphere is called the \textit{Brillouin sphere} (see \Cref{fig:brillouin_sphere}). The spherical harmonics model then induces deformities on the Brillouin sphere, thereby producing a non-spherical gravity field. The spherical harmonics gravity potential is stated as follows \parencite{scheeresBook}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    U(r, \delta, \lambda) = \frac{\mu}{r} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=0}^{l} \left(\frac{r_0}{r}\right)^l P_{lm} (\sin\delta) [C_{lm}\cos m\lambda + S_{lm}\sin m\lambda]
    \label{eqn:spherical_harmonics_general}
\end{align}
%%%
where $U$ is the gravitational potential calculated at a distance $r$ from the centre of the Brillouin sphere at latitude $\delta$ and longitude $\lambda$, $\mu$ is the gravitational parameter of the irregular body or asteroid, $r_0$ is the radius of the Brillouin sphere, $P_{lm}$ are the associated Legendre functions, $C_{lm}$ and $S_{lm}$ are the spherical harmonic coefficients which account for shape and density variations \parencite{romain2001ellipsoidal}, and $l$ and $m$ are the degree and order, respectively, of the spherical harmonic expansion. The definitions and calculations for the associated Legendre functions and the harmonics coefficients has been explained in detail by \cite{scheeresBook} and is not repeated here for brevity. The majority of gravity field perturbations can be accounted for by just considering the second degree and order in the spherical harmonics expansion. The potential is then expressed as follows \parencite{scheeresBook}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    U = \frac{\mu}{r} \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{r_0}{r}\right)^2 \left\{C_{20} \left(1-\frac{3}{2}\cos^2\delta\right) + 3C_{22}\cos^2\delta \cos(2\lambda) \right\} \right]
    \label{eqn:spherical_harmonics_second_degree}
\end{align}
%%%
where the spherical harmonic coefficients can be obtained from the principle moments of inertia as defined in \cite{scheeresBook}.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
%%%
Now consider a general statement for the gravity field of any arbitrary mass distribution $\mathcal{B}$ \parencite{scheeresBook}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    U = \frac{\mu}{V} \int_{\mathcal{B}} \frac{dV}{|\bvector{r} - \bvector{\rho}|}
    \label{eqn:general_gravity_field}
\end{align}
%%%
where $V$ is the volume, $\bvector{r}$ is the position vector to the point where the potential is being calculated, $\bvector{\rho}$ is the position vector to the discrete mass distribution within $\mathcal{B}$. If the potential is being calculated for a point that lies outside the maximum radius of the mass distribution being considered, then the integrand in \Cref{eqn:general_gravity_field} can be expanded into the following Laplace series form \parencite{scheeresBook}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{|\bvector{r} - \bvector{\rho}|} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{\rho}{r}\right)^i P_{i0} \left(\frac{\bvector{r} \cdot \bvector{\rho}}{r\rho}\right)
    \label{eqn:general_grav_term_laplace_series}
\end{align}
%%%
where $P_{i0}$ are the Legendre polynomials. Thus using \Cref{eqn:general_grav_term_laplace_series}, the integral in \Cref{eqn:general_gravity_field} can be restated as follows \parencite{scheeresBook}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{V} \int_{\mathcal{B}} \left(\frac{\rho}{r}\right)^i P_{i0} \left(\frac{\bvector{r} \cdot \bvector{\rho}}{r\rho}\right) dV
    \label{eqn:general_gravity_field_modified_integral}
\end{align}
%%%
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the integral in \Cref{eqn:general_gravity_field_modified_integral} and the $i$th degree and order spherical harmonics gravity field. Thus by looking at the Laplace series in \Cref{eqn:general_grav_term_laplace_series} and the integral in \Cref{eqn:general_gravity_field_modified_integral}, we can infer on the convergence or divergence of the spherical harmonics gravity field. Since the maximum radius of the mass distribution in case of the spherical harmonics model would be that of the circumscribing or Brillouin sphere, then for a point on this sphere, i.e. $r = |\bvector{\rho}|$, the Laplace series is not defined and for a point inside the sphere, i.e. $r < |\bvector{\rho}|$, the Laplace series diverges. This is the limitation for using the spherical harmonics model for an irregular body when one wants to compute orbital motion in close-proximity to the body. If the computation points are within the Brillouin sphere then the spherical harmonics series might diverge to a value that does not represent the true gravitational potential value and hence lead to errors in orbit computations. We can see from \Cref{fig:brillouin_sphere} that the volume of divergence for irregularly shaped asteroids can be quite significant. Thus, this model is definitely not suitable for our research since we are dealing with close-proximity orbits and above all, particle re-impact scenarios.

%%%
The above problem can be mitigated, to a certain extent, by using the \textit{ellipsoidal harmonics} expansion for representing the gravity potential of an irregular body. An extremely detail account on this model is given by \cite{dechambre2002transformation}. In the ellipsoidal harmonics model, instead of a sphere, a triaxial ellipsoid is used to circumscribe the irregular body and proves to be a better fit as shown in \Cref{fig:brillouin_ellipsoid}. The ellipsoidal harmonics potential is then given as follows \parencite{dechambre2002transformation}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    U(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3) &= \mu \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{p=1}^{2n+1} \alpha_{np} \frac{E_n^p(\lambda_1)}{E_n^p(\lambda_1^{ref})} \times E_n^p(\lambda_2) E_n^p(\lambda_3) \text{; $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_1^{ref}$}
    \label{eqn:ellipsoidal_harmonics_inside} \\
    U(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3) &= \mu \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{p=1}^{2n+1} \alpha_{np} \frac{F_n^p(\lambda_1)}{F_n^p(\lambda_1^{ref})} \times E_n^p(\lambda_2) E_n^p(\lambda_3) \text{; $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_1^{ref}$}
    \label{eqn:ellipsoidal_harmonics_outside}
\end{align}
%%%
where $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)$ are the ellipsoidal coordinates, which are basically three real roots (solutions) in terms of $s$ for the following conic equation \parencite{garmier2002modeling}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \frac{x^2}{s^2 + a^2} + \frac{y^2}{s^2 + b^2} + \frac{z^2}{s^2 + c^2} = 1
    \label{eqn:conic_ellipsoidal}
\end{align}
%%%
where $(x, y, z)$ are the Cartesian coordinates and $(a, b, c)$ are the semi-major axes of the reference ellipsoid circumscribing the irregular body (note that $a=\lambda_1^{ref}$). In \Cref{eqn:ellipsoidal_harmonics_inside,eqn:ellipsoidal_harmonics_outside}, $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)$ are analogous to the radius $r$, latitude $\delta$ and longitude $\lambda$, respectively, of \Cref{eqn:spherical_harmonics_general}; $\alpha_{np}$ is the ellipsoidal harmonics expansion coefficient similar to the spherical harmonics coefficient $C_{lm}$ and $S_{lm}$; $F_n^p()$ are the Lam\'e function of second kind of degree $n$ and order $p$ and is analogous to the attenuation term $(r_0 / r)^l$ of the spherical harmonics expansion in \Cref{eqn:spherical_harmonics_general}; $E_{n}^p()$ is the Lam\'e function of the first kind of degree $n$ and order $p$; and finally, the product term $E_{n}^p(\lambda_2)E_{n}^p(\lambda_3)$ is analogous to the product term $P_{lm} (\sin\delta) [C_{lm}\cos m\lambda + S_{lm}\sin m\lambda]$ which in both cases models the surface harmonic \parencite{garmier2002modeling}. A detailed description on definition and calculation of the ellipsoidal harmonic coefficients and the Lam\'e functions of the first and the second kind can be found in \cite{dechambre2002transformation} and is not repeated here for brevity.
%
\newline\newline
%
Even in the case of ellipsoidal harmonics expansion model, the gravity potential calculated for a point inside the circumscribing ellipsoid can diverge from the true potential. But the advantage of this model over the spherical harmonics expansion is that the circumscribing reference ellipsoid reduces the volume of divergence around the irregular body, relative to a sphere, making close-proximity evaluations possible. However, relative to spherical harmonics expansion, the computation of the basis functions for ellipsoidal harmonics, i.e. the Lam\'e functions of the first and the second kind, is extremely complex. On top of that, with increasing degree of the harmonics model, the order of magnitude of the Lam\'e functions increases, which then runs the risk of arithmetic overflow, thereby impeding accurate calculations of the harmonic expansion for degrees above 10 to 15 \parencite{reimond2016spheroidal}. However, in their research, \cite{reimond2016spheroidal} have devised a new method to calculate the basis functions using logarithmic expressions which allows accurate harmonic expansions for degrees of upto 500 but the computational complexity also increases tremendously as stated by them. Ultimately, since we wish to express the motion of particles close to the surface of the asteroid, which also involves surface interactions, the approach of ellipsoidal harmonics expansion also fails.

\subsection{Constant Density Ellipsoid}
\label{subsec:constant_density_ellipsoid}
The gravity potential modeling methods discussed so far involved the use of surface harmonics on the circumscribing object (sphere or ellipsoid) to simulate a non-homogeneous gravity field for an irregular body. The major drawback with the harmonics approach was its divergence from the true potential value within the circumscribing volume. This problem can be mitigated all together by assuming a specific shape and density distribution for the irregular body in question. In this realm, there are the \gls{CDE} and constant density polyhedron gravity potential models. Unlike the harmonics expansion approach, these potential models are valid upto and on the surface of the shape that has been assumed for the irregular body in question \parencite{scheeresBook}. Hence, these models are perfect to study close-proximity motion of particles or spacecraft around an asteroid.

Consider a \gls{CDE} with semi-major axes $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ such that $\gamma \leq \beta \leq \alpha$. The shape of the triaxial ellipsoid is completely defined by the equation $(x/\alpha)^2 + (y/\beta)^2 + (z/\gamma)^2 \leq 1$. The density of the ellipsoid is assumed to be constant. Then the gravitational potential for a point external to such a body, i.e. \gls{CDE}, is defined by the following equation \parencite{scheeresBook}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    U(\bvector{r}) &= -\frac{3\mu}{4} \int_{\lambda(\bvector{r})}^{\infty} \phi(\bvector{r}, u) \frac{du}{\Delta(u)}
    \label{eqn:ellipsoid_potential_short_form} \\
    \phi(\bvector{r}, u) &= \frac{x^2}{\alpha^2 + u} + \frac{y^2}{\beta^2 + u} + \frac{z^2}{\gamma^2 + u} - 1
    \label{eqn:ellipsoid_potential_phi} \\
    \Delta(u) &= \sqrt{(\alpha^2 + u)(\beta^2 + u)(\gamma^2 + u)}
    \label{eqn:ellipsoid_potential_delta}
\end{align}
%%%
where $\bvector{r}$ is the position vector to the point, external to the \gls{CDE}, and is defined in the \gls{ARF}; $\lambda(\bvector{r})$ is a parameter defined by the equation $\phi(\bvector{r}, \lambda) = 0$, which is a cubic polynomial and the value $\lambda$ is the maximum real root of this polynomial \parencite{scheeresBook}. Now for the given ellipsoid, the equation for the family of confocal quadratic surfaces is given as follows \parencite{ellipsoid_potential_model}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    \frac{x^2}{\alpha^2 + u} + \frac{y^2}{\beta^2 + u} + \frac{z^2}{\gamma^2 + u} &= 1
    \label{eqn:confocal_quadrics}
\end{align}
%%%
where $u$ is a real-valued parameter whose value defines the type of the confocal quadratic surface. \Cref{eqn:confocal_quadrics} is a cubic polynomial in $u$ and can be solved to obtain three unequal real roots - $u_1, u_2, u_3$, such that the following relation holds true \parencite{ellipsoid_potential_model}:
%%%
\begin{align}
    -\alpha^2 < u_3 < -\beta^2 < u_2 < -\gamma^2 < u_1 < +\infty
    \label{eqn:confocal_quadrics_all_real_roots}

where $u_1$ is the maximum real root possible and at that value, \Cref{eqn:confocal_quadrics} defines another ellipsoid which is confocal to the original one defined by the semi-major axes $\rightarrow$ $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ \parencite{ellipsoid_potential_model}. Thus, the value of $\lambda$ in \Cref{eqn:ellipsoid_potential_short_form} conforms to a confocal ellipsoid for a given point external to the original ellipsoid (which in turn is modeling the asteroid).
% The standard definition of gravitational potential at a point is defined as the work required to move that point from infinity to the location of the point in question and in \Cref{eqn:ellipsoid_potential_short_form}, this is being done by moving through a family of confocal ellipsoids.

The potential defined by \Cref{eqn:ellipsoid_potential_short_form} appears to have a complicated computational process due to its integral form. However, the integral can be split into multiple parts such that each can be solved with the help of standard functions called \textit{Carlson's Elliptic Integrals} \parencite{carlsonEllipticIntegral}. Software routines for these integrals exist in several computing languages which, for our case, helps in computing the \gls{CDE} gravitational potential. The integral defined in \Cref{eqn:ellipsoid_potential_short_form,eqn:ellipsoid_potential_phi,eqn:ellipsoid_potential_delta} is restated in its complete form as follows:
